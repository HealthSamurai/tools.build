tools.build
========================================

A library for building artifacts in Clojure projects.

# Usage as a library

```clojure
```

# Usage as a deps tool

Add to your deps.edn and add as a tool:

```clojure
{...
 {:aliases
  {:build
   {:deps {org.clojure/tools.build {:git/url "git@github.com:cognitect-labs/tools.build.git"
                                    :sha "5a0b814b6fc4e6d8fa03b9e64d93aef68f4f92a8"}}
    :main-opts ["build/make.clj"]}}}}
```

Example build script `(build/make.clj`):

```clojure
(require '[clojure.tools.build :as build])

(build/build
  '{:params
    {:build/target-dir "target"
     :build/class-dir "target/classes"
     :build/clj-paths ["src"]
     :build/copy-specs [{:from ["resources"]}]
     :build/src-pom "pom.xml"
     :build/lib your.org/lib
     :git-version/template "0.1.%s"
     :git-version/version> :flow/version
     :build/version :flow/version}
    :tasks [[clean]
            [clojure.tools.build.extra/git-version]
            [copy]
            [sync-pom]
            [jar]
            [install]]})

```

Run it in your current project:

```
clj -A:build
```
