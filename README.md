tools.build
========================================

A library for building artifacts in Clojure projects.

# Usage as a library

```clojure
```

# Usage as a deps tool

Add to your deps.edn and add as a tool:

```clojure
{...
 :aliases
 {:build
  {:deps {org.clojure/tools.build {:git/url "git ls-remote https://github.com/clojure/tools.build.git refs/heads/master"
                                   :sha "<SHA>"}
          org.clojure/tools.deps.alpha {:git/url "https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha.git"
                                        :sha "<SHA>"}}
          org.slf4j/slf4j-nop {:mvn/version "1.7.25"}
   :run-fn clojure.tools.build/build
   :run-args {:tasks [[clean] [copy] [sync-pom] [jar]]
              :params {:build/target-dir "target"
                       :build/class-dir "classes"
                       :build/copy-specs [{:from :clj-paths}]
                       :build/src-pom "pom.xml"
                       :build/lib my/lib1
                       :build/version "1.2.3"}}}
  }}
```

You can find the latest shas for these projects with:

    git ls-remote git@github.com:cognitect-labs/tools.build.git refs/heads/master
    git ls-remote https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha.git refs/heads/calc-basis


Run it: 

```
clj -A:build -X:build
```

Override a parameter like version:

```
clj -A:build -X:build :params:build/version "\"2.2.2\""
```
