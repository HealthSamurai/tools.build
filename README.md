tools.build
========================================

A library for building artifacts in Clojure projects.

# Usage as a library

```clojure
(require '[clojure.tools.build :as build] '[clojure.tools.build.tasks :as tasks])
(-> (build/build-info
      :deps "deps.edn"
      :params [{:build/lib 'foo/bar, :build/version "1.2.3"})]
    tasks/clean
    tasks/sync-pom
    tasks/jar)
```

# Usage as a deps tool

Likely to change...

Define the initial build parameters 

Add tools.build in as an alias in your ~/.clojure/deps.edn so it's available in any project:

```clojure
```

Run it in your current project:

```
clj -A:build
```
